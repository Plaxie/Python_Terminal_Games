# Python Terminal Games
This repostiory is the home for simple terminal games made using python, made to learn. The games will slowly and surely get more complicated like chess or pong. But will remain within terminal level, everything will be made from in-built plugins, which means no numpy, no pygame, no utilities from external, etc. This is to maintain that all games work without much requiring to be installed and also raising the difficulty as I'll have to design a different graphic style for every game, that is to say all games will be made from a 0b file 😎 No A.I code will be utilized 💀 Everything depends on my knowledge. 

Games at the beginning will avoid using OOP completely and work with just functions, but games like chess will require Classes and Objects. but those are later in the line.

### Current list of games to make:
- `X or O             ✅`
- `Sequence Solver    ✅`
- `S O S Board Game   ☑️`
- `4 Red / 4 Blue     ◯`
- `Chess              ◯`
- `Pong               ❕`

**✅: Completed, ☑️: Incomplete, ◯: Not Begun, ❕:In mind, Don't plan to; any time soon**

More Can be suggested 😅
